    <h1>This is My Javascript Study</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a progamming language largely used for front-end Web development, 
        but it can also be used for backend using frameworks like node.js. <br>
        Whereas HTML creates elements and CSS styles them, Javascript makes them "do stuff".<br>
        This page was built to explore as many Javascript concepts as possible.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Intro to Datatypes</h2>
        <p>First of all, like most programming languages, Javascript uses Primitive data types:</p>
            <div id="dataTypes">
                <dt>Boolean:</dt>
                    <dd><code>true</code> or <code>false</code></dd>
                <dt>Numbers:</dt>
                    <dd>A number between<code>-(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1)</code> could also be a decimal (or <i>"float-point"</i> number), 
                    or <code>NaN</code> "Not a Number" or <code>+Infinity</code> or <code>-Infinity</code> </dd>
                <dt>Strings:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <code>"The actual words or characters you want inside of either single ('') or double ("") quotations"</code> 
                    </dd>
                <dt>Null:</dt>
                    <dd>Only has one value: <code>Null</code>, which is the intentional absence of any object value </dd>
                <dt>Undefined:</dt>
                    <dd><code>Undefined</code> means no value was assigned or returned</dd>
                <dt>BigInt:</dt>
                    <dd>If you some reason need a huge number that is above <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code>, you can put a "n" at the end of it and then its one of these...</dd>
                <dt>Symbol:</dt>
                    <dd>A unique and immutable value. Perhaps the key of an Object property? </dd>
            </div>
          
        <h2>Objects:</h2>
        <p>Objects are basically collections of properties. You will often see properties with key, value pairs.
            Property types include data properties and accessor properties.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The docs list "Data Properties" as Value (any type), Writable, Enumerable, Configurable or, conversely,
            Read-only, DontEnum and DontDelete. These would all be boolean values, except Value, which can be any data type.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Accessor Properties include: Get and Set (both would have a function object or be undefined),
            also Enumerable and Configurable (both boolean values). 
        </p>
            <div id=objTypes>
                <h3>Normal Objects</h3>
                <p>A normal object is a mapping between keys and values.  A function is a "callable" object.</p>
                <dt>Dates</dt>
                    <dd>This is a built in object type and can be accessed with: <code>new Date()</code>.</dd>
                <dt>Indexed Collections--Arrays: </dt>
                    <dd><code>["lists", "of", "strings", "or", ["more", "arrays"], "or", 
                        {type: objects, conjunction: with, key: value }, "pairs", "or", 1948, 10]</code>
                        <br>Arrays can be manipulated with Array.prototype methods.</dd>
                <dt>Typed Arrays:</dt>
                    <dd>Typed arrays are a beast I have not really dealt with. They do exist though, and maybe one day I will figure it out and describe them.</dd>
                <dt>Keyed Collections (Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, WeakSets):</dt>
                    <dd>Again, not sure about this, and will fill in later.</dd>
                <dt>JSON: Javascript Object Notation</dt>
                    <dd>Ooh, I actually understand this one!!  JSON looks like this:<br>
                        <code>{<br>
                                "name": "Chris",<br>
                                "description": "This is how JSON looks"<br>
                            }</code><br>  Remember to use double-quotes and put commas in between! JSON is a popular database format. </dd>
            </div>       
        
    </section>

        <h2>How To Manipulate Data:</h2>
        <p>Ok, so now that we have our basic data types, we will have to learn to do somthing with them</p>
        <h3>Variables and Constants</h3>
        <p>Data must be defined in some way in order to use it, so we must create variables or constants.<br>
        Formerly, the keyword <code>var</code> was used to define variables. <br> While you can still use this, the new way of defining is like so:
        <br><code>let variableInCamelCase;</code> <br> would create the variableInCamelCase, while <br><code>let variableInCamelCase = "variable";</code><br>
        would both create it and define it as the string "variable".</p>
        <p>
            Similarly, if the piece of data will remain constant throughout program, you may use the keyword const:<br> <code>const WIDTH = 600px</code><br>
            In some instances, constants are capitalized.
        </p>
        <p>
           In my Javascript file, "main.js", I have written the following code:<br>
           <code>var variable= "old way of variables"</code><br>
            <code>let variableInCamelCase = "variable"</code><br>
            <code> const WIDTH = 600</code><br>
            <code>let doesIt = true</code> <br>
            <code> document.getElementById("variables").innerHTML= variable + ", " + variableInCamelCase +", " + WIDTH;</code><br>
            Here, I have set the "innerHTML" of my HTML element with the id of "variables" to list the following:<br>
            variable, variableInCamelCase, WIDTH  and doesIt along with a comma and space in between terms. <br>
            Notice how a "+" operator is used to "concatenate" strings, or "put them together" <br>
            Below is the div tag with the id "variables":
        </p>
        <p id="variables"></p>
        <p>In this example, variable and variableInCamelCase are both strings, WIDTH is a number and doesIt has a boolean value of true.</p>

        <h2>Linking Javascript to HTML and console.log()</h2>
        <h3>Adding a Script Tag</h3>
        <p>Before we get too much further along, it is probably a good time to mention a couple important and helpful concepts.<br>
        In order for Javascript to work properly ( or even at all), we will need to link it to our HTML much like we link CSS to our pages.<br>
        For this purpose, we use a "script" tag in the HTML at the bottom of the body element of the HTML.<br>
        Why at the bottom, you ask?  This is because the page renders top to bottom, and if the Javascript file was linked at the top,
        then the elements that are referred to in the js file would not yet exist and therefore, could not yet be manipulated by the javascript file.
        So, what we would do to make a javascript file named "main.js" functional would look like this:<br>
        </p>   
        <code id="js"></code>
        <p>This script tag would go directly above the body closing tag. Here, "src" stands for "source"  <br>
        In this example, I created an element with id "js" and a constant "jsScript" then used <code>document.getElementById("js").textContent = jsScript</code><br>
        to fill in the code example.</p>
        <h3>Using console.log()</h3>
        <p>Most Internet Browsers have a "console" in the "developer tools" section. (Firefox doesn't do this properly).<br>
            You can use the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + I" to open the dev-tools or you can click through to them in the upper right corner of your browser.<br>
            To click through, click the 3 vertical dots in the upper right corner, then click "More tools" and then "developer tools"<br>
            In the dev-tools console for this page you will find that I made a console.log() with the string "This is a console.log() of a string" inside the parenthesis.<br>
            This message, and others can be found in the console, along with several other helpful tools, including a responsive design mode that will
            let you see what your web-app will look like on different sized screens, an element inspector and others.<br>
            Using the console to log various things can help you figure out what is going on and debug your pages. <br>
            For instance, you can put a variable inside to see if it is acting like you think it should and evaluate from there.<br>
            The code for this console log is as follows:</p>
            <code id="console">console.log("This is a console.log() of a string");</code>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
            In Javascript, we use functions to create and name a reusable piece of code that performs the same operation everytime, perhaps on different pieces of data.
            The older way of defining a function called "oldFunction" is like so:
        </p>
        <code id="oldFunction">function oldFunction() {<br>
            contents of function here<br>
        };</code>
        <p>
            Here, I have made a function in my main.js file called "ahoy" that creates an "alert" with a string in it when clicked using an html onclick property.<br>
            The function itself looks like this:
        </p>
        <code id="function">function ahoy(){<br>
            alert("Ahoy!! Consider yourself alerted!);<br>
        };</code>
        <p>The element property inside of the html opening tag that enables this looks like this:</p>
                <code id="ahoy">onclick="ahoy()"</code>
        <button onclick="ahoy()">Click here to see the alert!</button>
        <p>There is a more modern syntax for creating functions as well.<br>
              <i>Arrow functions</i> reduce the number of characters needed to create functions, and allow your functions to be stored as constants.<br>
            The syntax for an arrow functions is like this: </p>
        <code id="arrow">const arrowFunc = () => {console.log("This string came from the function named 'arrowFunc' ")};</code>    
        <p>The arrow function is then called when needed with parenthesis after like so:</p>
        <code>arrowFunc();</code>
        <p>Say you wanted a function to deal with a variable or constant.  You can "feed" these pieces of data 
            to your function as "arguments".  For instance, say you want to add a variable to a known number, 
            you could create a function that looks something like this:
        </p>
        <code>let num = 10<br>
        const add = (num) => {return num + 5};</code>
        <p>
            This would return the value 15 as it is currently written. However, you could reassign the value of "num"
            and then the function "add" would add 5 to the current value of "num".
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Operators:</h2>
        <p>
            In the previous function, we used the plus, "+" operator to add a number to a variable which was also a number.
            We had previously used the "+" operator to concatenate strings together, which is another use for it.
            We have also seen the equals "=" sign in use as we have applied it to create variables and assigned them values.
            After the original assigning of a variables value, it can be changed later using the "=" sign.
        </p>
        <code>let amount = 20<br>
        amount = 15</code>
        <p>
            In this example, we have reassigned the value of "amount" from its original designation of 20 to a new value of 15.
            We could also add or subtract from it in the following fashion:
        </p>
        <code>amount += 10</code>
        <p>Now, "amount" is equal to 25</p>
        <code>amount -= 12</code>
        <p>Now, "amount" is equal to 13.  <br>
        You could also add or subtract like this:</p>
        <code>amount = amount + 5</code>
        <p>Now, amount would be equal to 18<br>
        Similarly, as you may have guessed, we can also multiply using <code>*</code> or divide using <code>/</code>.<br>
        You can also use <code>*=</code> or <code>/=</code> to assign a variable a new value multiplied or divided by a value, 
        much like as is done above with <code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code><br>
        Additionally, we can use comparison operators like "greater than" and "less than". <code>></code> and <code><</code>.<br>
        Also, as you may expect, we also have <code>>=</code> and <code><=</code> for "greater than or equal to" and 
        "less than or equal to", respectively.<br>
        We also can check the equality of various data using <code>==</code> for "loose equality" or <code>===</code>
        for "strict equality".  For instance the string <code>"45"</code> loosely equals the number <code>45</code>,
        but the two are not strictly equal to one another.<br>
        We could also use <code>!</code> to mean "not".  Thus <code>!==</code> would be strict non-equality, Whereas
        <code>!=</code> would represent loose non-equality.
        </p> 
        <h3>Other Operators:</h3>
        <p>There are a few other operators you will want to know about. The <code>%</code> operator will give you the remainder
        of dividing two numbers. For instance, the following would return 2:<br></p>
        <code>8 % 3;</code>
        <p>Also available is <code>**</code> which will deliver exponents. The following would return 9:</p>
        <code>3**2;</code>
        <p>You can increment or decrement a number or variable by one using <code>++</code>or <code>--</code><br>
        Then <code>9++;</code> would return 10, and <code>6--;</code> would return 5.</p>
        <p>Finally, for now, we have "and" represented by <code>&&</code> as well as <code>||</code> representing  "or". </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Conditionals:</h2>
        <p>Conditional Statements in Javascript are used to make different things happen in different scenarios.
            Mainly, these are "if/else" statements, potentially along with "else if" statements. Handily, 
            in javascript, these statements use this exact wording, so an if/else statement with an else if statement included
            would look something like this:
        </p>
        <code>let num = 9;<br>
            let string;<br>
            if (num >= 10) {<br>
            string = "It is at least 10";<br>
            } else if (num < 2 && num > 0 || num === 5){ <br>
            string = "It is between 2 and 0 or it is 5";<br>
            } else {<br>
                string = "It is under 10, but not it is not 5 and its not between 2 and 0";<br>
            };
            </code>
        <p>Additionally, we can use a simpler syntax for conditional statements that looks like this:</p>
        <code> (num === 9) ? string = "It is nine!" : string = "It isn't nine...";</code>  
        <p>In this example, we check if num is strictly equal to nine, so we first have a term to evaluate,
            then we have a question mark <code>?</code> followed by what to do if the statement evaluates as true.<br>
            In this instance, if it is true, we assign the value of the variable string to "It is nine!"
            Following that, we have a colon <code>:</code>, after which we have the code to execute if the statement 
            evaluates false, which is setting the value of "string" to "It isn't nine..."
        </p>  
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Loops:</h2>
        <p>There are a couple of different Loops in javascript that we can use to replay certain lines of code while 
            certain conditions are met, and quit replaying those same lines if the condition is no longer met.
            Our two basic kinds of loops are the "for loop" and the "while loop".  One must be somewhat careful 
            when creating loops to ensure that they do not create an infinite loop that does not ever stop because 
            the condition under which it would stop never happens.  This could be a way to crash your computer.<br>
            The following is the basic syntax for a "for loop".
        </p>
        <code>for (let i = 0; i <= array.length; i++) {<br>
        array[i] += 2;<br>
        }</code>
        <p>In this example there are a few concepts we have already covered and a couple that we have not yet discussed.
            Lets look at each piece of this piece of code.  First, we have the keyword <code>for</code> followed
            by a few things inside of parenthesis.  The first thing inside the parenthesis is a declaration of the variable <code>i</code>
            as <code>0</code> followed by a semi-colon.  Next, we have the condition that the code will use to decide whether to 
            continue re-executing itself.  If that condition, in this case <code>i <= array.length;</code>, is no longer met 
            then the loop will end. We will get more into array methods later, but here we are checking the length of the array
            and the loop is set to run once for each element of the array. Note that the condition is also followed by a semi-colon.  The final piece of code inside the 
            parenthesis is <code>i++</code>, which is a line of code to run after each time the loop is executed.
            In this example, and often, you will increment the <code>i</code> variable, and execute once for each index in the array. <br>
            Then you will notice that we have some curly braces, much like a function, and indeed, this is the code that
            will be executed each time the loop runs.  This time we are simply adding 2 to whatever data is pre-existing in the 
            array called "array" (which presumably already exists).
        </p>
        <p>Next up, we have the "while loop".  While for loops are often used to loop through arrays or indexed collections, the while loop 
            can simply execute themselves a certain number of times.  A while loop syntactically looks like this:
        </p>
        <code>let x = 1;<br>
            while (x <= 10) {<br>
            console.log("Dude, it is still less than or equal to 10");<br>
            x++;<br>
            };
        </code>
        <p>Here, the variable x is set to the value 1, then the condition to execute loop code is set as 
            <code>x <= 10</code>, then comes the code to re-execute as long as the loop plays.  Here is it simply
            console logging a string. Next comes the important piece of code if you don't want to create an infinite loop:
            <code>x++;</code>.  This incrementation of the variable is what will cause the condition of x being less than or 
            equal to 10 to no longer be true after a number of times through the loop, causing the loop to stop replaying itself.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>String Methods:</h2>
        <p>As defined above, strings are characters inside of either single or double quotes that are to be interepreted
            literally as the characters themselves.  This may be a word or a sentence, with alpha-numeric characters or even symbols.
        </p>
        <h3>String Constructor:</h3>
        <p>You can call <code>String(argument)</code> as a function an the argument provided in the parenthesis will become a string.<br>
        Conversely, you could use <code>new String(argument)</code> to create a string object. However, the former is supposedly more useful,
         while the latter is not recommended. </p>
        <p>Consider this: <code>let arg = String("argument")</code>. Now the string <b>arg</b> equals <span id="argument" style="color: rgb(163, 57, 19)"></span> and can be utilized as such.
        The variable arg is also logged in the console.</p>
        <h3>Static String Methods:</h3>
        <h4>String.fromCharCode()</h4>
        <p><code>String.fromCharCode(num, num1, num2)</code> would produce a string from unicode, with each num argument being the unicode code 
        of the desired character.  You will want to know unicode if this is going to work for you. Here we will just see what happens. </p>
        <code>num = 65;<br>
            num1 = 126;<br>
            num2= 75;<br>
            let unicodeString = String.fromCharCode(num, num1, num2);<br>
            document.getElementById(unicodeStr).textContent = unicodeString;</code>
        <p>Here is a span  (in purple) with the id="unicodeStr" containing the string we just created. <span id="unicodeStr" style="color:purple"></span></p>
        <h4>String.fromCodePoint()</h4>
        <p>We can use <code>String.fromCodePoint(num3, num4, num5)</code> will similarly produce a string from the num arguments.
        I know basically nothing about code point.</p>
        <code>num3 = 0x4905;<br>
            num4 = 45;<br>
            num5= 0x9804;<br>
            let codePointString = String.fromCharCode(num3, num4, num5);<br>
            document.getElementById("codePtStr").textContent = codePointString;</code>
            <p>Apparently, here I have randomly selected numbers that are perhaps Chinese from code point:  <span id="codePtStr" style="color:purple"></span>.  
            Clearly, I have no real clue about what code point really is.  This will be addressed in more detail some other time.</p>
        <h4>String.raw()</h4>
        <p> <code>String.raw()</code> is another static string method, usually used with template literals: <code>${literalGoesHere}</code>.<br>
        The main thing that seems to happen with this method is that normal escape characters are not escaped and instead are used literally as characters. 
        This includes backslashes and newline characters.  <code>let rawStr = String.raw`/bust\Raw/Dawg`</code>
        Then we would use a template literal to use the string we have created.  Remember to look closely because we are using back-ticks rather than single quotes here. 
        This will make a difference when using template literals. We also omit the parenthesis when using this method.</p>   
        <code>
            let rawStr = String.raw`/bust/Raw/Dawg`;<br>
            console.log(`yo this is a rawStr: ${rawStr}`);<br>
            document.getElementById("raw").textContent= `Yo, this is a rawStr: ${rawStr}`;
        </code>
        <p>Here is the raw stuff in purple (span element has id of "raw" here): <span id="raw" style="color:purple"></span>  
        <br>This is also logged in the console.</p>
        <h3>String.prototype Methods (and a property):</h3>
        <h4>String.length()</h4>
        <p>String.prototype.length is a read-only method that returns the length of the string.<br>
        <code> document.getElementById("length").textContent = `unicodeString:  ${unicodeString}, unicodeString.length:  ${unicodeString.length}`</code> would render the length of our variable "unicodeString" in the span element below. <br>
        <span id="length" style="color: purple"></span> <br>
        This has also been console logged. This is basically the same as the array.length method and is often used in creating loops.</p>
        <h4>String.prototype.at()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.at(index)</code>  will return the character in a string that is at the specified index.<br> For instance, <code>arg.at(3);</code> would be <span id="at" style="color:purple"></span> on account that the character at index 3 of "argument" is the 'u'.</p>
        <p>You can also get specific characters using a negative index number: <code>arg.at(-1);</code> which would return <span id="atNeg"></span> because 't' is the last character in "argument".</p>
        <h4>String.prototype.charAt()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.charAt()</code> will also return a UTF-16 character at specified index, but doesn't do negative indices</p>
        <h4>String.prototype.charCodeAt()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.charCodeAt(index)</code> will return the UTF-16 character code at the specified index.<br>
        <code>arg.charCodeAt(2);</code> would return <span id="charCodeAt"></span></p>
        <h4>String.prototype.codePointAt()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.codePointAt(index)</code> will return the unicode code point at the specified index.<br>
            <code>arg.codePointAt(3);</code> would return <span id="codePointAt"></span></p>
        <h4>String.prototype.concat()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.concat(str1, str2)</code> will concatenate (or combine) strings together.<br>
            <code>arg.concat(variableInCamelCase, " ", rawStr);</code> would return the string <span id="concat"></span></p>
        <h4>String.prototype.endsWith()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.endsWith(StringToCheck, optionalLength)</code> will check if a string contains another string (stringToCheck) at its end.
            The "length" parameter is optional and if provided will replace the default of String.length. Operation is case-sensitive.<br>
            <code>rawStr.endsWith("Dawg");</code> would return a boolean value, in this instance: <span id="endsWith"></span></p>
        <h4>String.prototype.includes()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.includes(StringToCheck, optionalPosition)</code> will check if a string contains another string (stringToCheck).
           <br> The "position" parameter is optional and, if provided, will replace the search's beginning location default of index 0. Operation is case-sensitive.<br>
            <code>rawStr.includes("RAW");</code> would return a boolean value, in this instance: <span id="includes"></span> because our variable "rawStr" includes "Raw", but not "RAW".</p>
        <h4>String.prototype.indexOf()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.indexOf(stringToCheck, optionalPosition)</code> will check if a string contains another string (stringToCheck) and if so,
             will return the index of the stringToCheck in the original string.<br>
            The "position" parameter is optional and, if provided, will replace the search's beginning location default of index 0.<br>
             Operation is case-sensitive.<br>
            <code>variable.indexOf("way");</code> would return an index number, in this instance: <span id="indexOf"></span> because our variable "variable" includes 
            "way" at the index 4. <br>
             If the stringToCheck is not contained in the string, then the value <span id="indexOf2"></span> is returned. </p>
        <h4>String.prototype.lastIndexOf()</h4>
        <p><code>String.prototype.lastIndexOf(stringToCheck, optionalPosition)</code> will check if a string contains another string (stringToCheck) and if so,
            will return the index of the last occurrence of stringToCheck in the original string.<br>
           The "position" parameter is optional and, if provided, will replace the search's ending location which by default is <code>+Infinity</code>.<br>
            If the position argument is longer than the string, this method will check the entire string.  Operation is case-sensitive.<br>
           <code>variable.lastIndexOf("a");</code> would return an index number, in this instance: <span id="lastIndexOf"></span> because our variable "variable"'s last occurrence of  
           "a" is at the index 15. <br>
            If the stringToCheck is not contained in the string, for instance with the following:    <code>variable.lastIndexOf("z");</code> then the value <span id="lastIndexOf2"></span> is returned,
            indicating that there is no such occurrence in the string. </p>
        <h4>String.prototype.localeCompare()</h4>
        <h4>String.prototype.match()</h4>
        <h4>String.prototype.matchAll()</h4>
